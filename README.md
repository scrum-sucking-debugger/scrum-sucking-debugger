- 👋 Hi, I’m @scrum-sucking-debugger
- 👀 I’m interested in full-stack development, with a keen focus on using JavaScript frameworks like React and Vue, as well as exploring backend technologies like Node.js and GraphQL. I have a passion for building scalable, efficient web applications and am always on the lookout for new and challenging projects that push the boundaries of what's possible on the web.

🌱 I’m currently learning more about cloud-native technologies, diving deeper into Kubernetes, Docker, and serverless architectures. I'm also exploring the potential of AI and machine learning in web development, studying how to integrate AI-driven features into traditional web applications to enhance user experience and functionality.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects that aim to solve real-world problems or create innovative tools for developers. I'm especially excited about contributing to projects related to environmental sustainability, education technology, or healthcare, where technology can have a significant positive impact.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I once participated in a 48-hour hackathon where my team and I developed a fully functional app that utilized augmented reality to enhance online shopping experiences. Not only did we manage to integrate complex AR features from scratch, but we also learned three new programming languages in the process. This experience solidified my belief in the power of caffeine, collaboration, and the endless possibilities within the realm of software development.
